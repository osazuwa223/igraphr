Package: igraphr
Type: Package
Title: Adds common graph operations to R igraph that makes graph manipulation via igraph simpler and easier to do. 
Version: 0.1
Author: Robert Ness
Description: igraphr creates higher level graph operations build upon the basic graph data 
             structure and graph operations found in igraph.  igraphr is useful to those 
             who like using igraph as their primary tool for working with graph data 
             structures, and is looking for some extended functionality, especially with more 
             commonly used graph and tree search algorithms.
