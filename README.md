# lucy

*lucy* creates higher level graph operations build upon the basic graph data structure and graph operations found in igraph.  A simple example is the function *iparents*, which returns the parents of a node in a graph, as opposed to having to write: 

    V(g)[nei(v, mode="out")]

*lucy* is useful to anyone who likes using *igraph* as their primary tool for working with graph data structures.
