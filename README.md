# lucy

*lucy* is a wrapper for the popular [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/) package.  Though built with applications to probabilistic graphical models (eg. Bayesian networks and artificial neural networks) in mind, *lucy* is generally useful to anyone who likes using *igraph* as a workhorse for manipulating graph data structures.

## Installation
This package is currently in development and not yet released on CRAN.

To get the current development version from github:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("robertness/lucy")
