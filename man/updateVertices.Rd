\title{Vertex/Edge Propagation in igraph}
\usage{
updateVertices(g, getDeterminers, callback)

updateEdges(g, getDeterminers, callback)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A graph object.}

\item{getDeterminers}{A function returns the vertice/edge indices that must be updated for the callback to be
executed.  Arguments: g - the graph object, i - the index of a vertex/edge in g. Returns: an array of indices
for the vertices/edges that are needed to perform the callback on vertex/edge i.}

\item{callback}{The function performed on each vertex/edge. Arguments: g - the graph object, i - the index of a graph/edge in g.
Returns: a graph object.}
}
\value{
A igraph object with updated vertex/edge states. A warning message is returned if not all vertices
could be updated.
}
\description{
Foundation for any graph propagation algorithm, where the states of vertexes or edges propagate through the graph,
changing the states of others.  Traverse the graph, land on a vertex/edge, perform a callback function on the
vertex/edge.  That callback can depend on the states of other 'determiner' vertices/edges.  When the callback is
completed successfully, the 'updated' attribute of the object is changed to \code{TRUE}. If those determiners do
not have the status \code{updated == TRUE}, then the function recursively performs the callback on the determiners until all
their states are updated, before finalling performing the callback on the original vertex/edge.

\details{
\code{updateVertices} performs propagation on vertices. \code{updateEdges} performs propagation on edges.
